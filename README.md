# Python-Chatbot-using-NLTK-Keras

In this Python project a chatbot is built using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. The method will use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then it will give a random response from the list of responses.

The project is essentially a retrieval based chatbot built using NLTK, Keras, Numpy etc.
